# AIR-CRASHES-FATALITY-REPORT
----
The 30 Days of Learning for students in Nigeria was organized by @theoyinbooke and Microsoft to aid students in acquiring relevant tech skills. The Air Crash & Fatality Report is the Capstone Project for the July Cohort. The analysis and visualization was carried out using Excel and Power BI.
----
# DATA SOURCE
The data was extracted as a .csv file from the Github repository of @TheOnyibooke
----
# DATA WRANGLING
The data set had 9 columns.
The data was analysed to answer the following observations:
1. What was the fatality and survival rate across the years? 
2. Which month had the highest and lowest rate of fatality and survival?
3. What type of planes caused the highest crashes?
----
INSIGHTS
1. There was a total of 4537 crashes between 1908 and 2009. 
2. There was a total of 140,000 passengers on board, with 102,000 suffering fatality and 38,000 beintg survivors.
3. The earlier years from 1908 to 1912 had very high fatality rates and low survival rates, this could be attributed to lack of modern technology being used.
4. The later part of the year from August to December also experienced more fatality. This can be attributed to hazy and winter weather conditions. 
5. The Zeppelin brand of planes also contributed to most of the crashes with high fatality.
----
RECOMMENDATION
1. More resources should be channelled towards deploying better and high grade technology, making safety the core value, and ensuring the cause of the fatalities are addressed during production. 
2. Aeronautics engineers for Zeppelin planes should be re-trained to keep updated with the technical skills required in order to build and maintain planes.
3. During winter, less flights should be scheduled to minimize air crashes due to poor weather conditions. Flights should also be monitored round the clock to ensure initial signals of distress are responded to, in order to increase chances of survival.
